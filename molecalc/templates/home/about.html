        <h1>What is MoleCalc?</h1>

        <p>
            MoleCalc is a Python-based web app and chemistry teaching tool that
            allows chemists to build small molecules and estimate key molecular
            properties using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry software.
            Currently, MoleCalc can provide, in a matter of minutes or seconds, a
            decent sense of the physical and chemical properties of a chosen
            molecule, such as
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>energy-minimized molecular structure</li>
            <li>electronic structure and molecular orbitals</li>
            <li>thermochemical properties of the molecular gas form</li>
            <li>vibrational modes and their frequencies</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Why do we need MoleCalc?</h1>

        <p>
            MoleCalc, which is being developed by the
            <a href="https://biopchem.education/news/yarger-research-group/">
            Yarger Research Group</a> at Arizona State University for chemistry
            "cloud lab" courses in the <a href="https://sms.asu.edu/">
            School of Molecular Sciences at Arizona State University</a>, is an
            evolution of the original <a href="https://molcalc.org/">MolCalc</a>
            web app developed by the <a href="propka.ki.ku.dk/~jhjensen">Jensen
                Group</a> at the University of Copenhagen using the
            <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a> Python web framework.

            MoleCalc has been ported to the Python (micro) web framework
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask</a>,
            a very popular web framework that is remarkably easy to use and
            well-suited for a rapidly evolving web applications. In particular,
            rebuilding MoleCalc in Flask makes it even simpler for new
            developers to contribute to MoleCalc's ongoing development,
            including the incorporation of new features and integration with
            other Flask-based cloud apps used for online chemistry lab courses
            at ASU.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The original <a href="https://molcalc.org/">MolCalc</a> web app was
            designed for teaching as opposed to research and, therefore, places
            an emphasis on running computations <em>quickly</em>. Indeed, so
            long as qualitative accuracy is sufficient, the speed of
            calculations is of primary importance since humans learn most
            effectively when real-time feedback is available. <strong>MoleCalc</strong>
            retains the spirit of the original app and is currently being
            stress-tested in the context of the upper-division
            <a href="https://biopchem.education/biopchem/courses/">CHM 343 lab
                course at ASU starting the Fall 2022 semester</a>. However, the
            ASU MoleCalc project has broader and longer-term ambitions driven by
            the central goal of improving student engagement with fundamental
            concepts in chemistry and physics.
        </p>


        <h2>Emphasis on physical intuition</h2>

        <p>
            The broader ASU MoleCalc effort is focused on leveraging
            computational methods to deeply integrate physical intuition with
            real or simulated experimental data using clickable explanations,
            dynamic visualizations, and interactive data. A guiding focus of our
            development efforts is to <i>make meaning transparent</i> by
            leveraging a web interface that will provide succinct explanations
            in a visual context, thereby allowing the user to concentrate on
            concepts rather than deciphering complicated programs and arcane
            terminologies.
        </p>

        <h2>Cloud-based physics and chemistry</h2>

        <p>
            Like the original MolCalc project, MoleCalc will continue being
            developed as an open source interactive chemistry teaching tool.
            MoleCalc serves as the starting point for the development of a more
            comprehensive visual-centric interface for cloud-based physics and
            chemistry lab courses. The idea is to have students develop physical
            and chemical intuition about how molecular structure affects
            molecular properties, without performing the underlying calculations
            by hand (which would be near impossible for all but the simplest
            chemical systems). In particular, we envision developing a tool that
            establishes concrete conceptual pathways from representative
            experimental plots and data to the mechanistic physical/chemical
            picture that directly underlies that data.
        </p>

        <h1>What technologies does MoleCalc use?</h1>

        <p>MoleCalc uses standard HTML and CSS3, along with the technologies and software
          packages described below.</p>

        <h2>Front-end components</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript (<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">JSmol</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Back-end components</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Python (<a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a></li>
            <li>JavaScript (<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/">GAMESS</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.faccts.de/orca/">Orca</a> (coming soon!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does MoleCalc perform electronic structure calculations?</h2>

        <p>Great question! Currently, MoleCalc uses
          <a href="https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/">The General Atomic and Molecular
              Electronic Structure System (GAMESS)</a>, which is maintained by the Gordon
          research group at Iowa State University. We are also in the process of incorporating
          <a href="https://www.faccts.de/orca/">Orca</a> as a user-selectable option for quantum
          chemistry calculation.
        </p>
